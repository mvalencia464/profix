4. Exception: Competitive Market Add-On
* Trigger: Highly competitive metropolitan markets (e.g., Downtown Chicago, Manhattan) where topical relevance alone is insufficient21.
* Strategy: Create additional content for Geographical Relevance22.
* Tactics: Target specific neighborhoods rather than just the broad city.
* Impact: This can significantly increase the total word count beyond the standard Core 30 range (e.g., up to 170+ pieces of content)23.
