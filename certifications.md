Logo API Usage Guidelines
Instantly add any company logos to your app or website

Logo API is free to use and we don’t ask for any attribution.
​
Authentication
To use Logo API, you must include your clientId with every request.
Adding your clientId provides reliable access, supports fair usage, and keeps consistent performance across all requests.
Create a free account and access your clientId from the developer portal.
Include your clientId in each request as shown in the example below:
<img
  src="https://cdn.brandfetch.io/:domain?c=BRANDFETCH_CLIENT_ID"
  alt="Logos by Brandfetch"
/>
​
Hotlinking
We require logo links to be directly embedded in your applications.
Embedding logo links directly within your HTML image tags guarantees that the logo remains up-to-date at all times. It also ensures a faster and more reliable implementation.
👉 When embedding a logo link, HTTP requests must include the Referer header with the request origin. Your HTTP Referrer-Policy header must be set to one of: origin, origin-when-cross-origin, strict-origin, strict-origin-when-cross-origin (browser default), or unsafe-url.
⚠️ Programmatic access to logo images is not permitted and may result in rate limiting or blocking. Scraping logos will also lead to a block.
